The trajectory details the journey of an AI engineer bringing the Nuestra Carne application from a 95% complete state to a fully functional one. The initial challenge involved resolving a frontend-backend disconnection due to misconfigured URLs and a misidentified backend (Node.js/Express instead of the assumed Python/FastAPI). The engineer meticulously corrected supervisor configurations, environment variables, and critically, added the  prefix to numerous frontend API calls.

Subsequently, image display issues arose, leading to the implementation of local SVG placeholders after external image hosts blocked downloads. The final, most significant task involved building out a full order management system: persisting orders in a JSON file on the backend, connecting the user dashboard to real order data, and creating an administrative interface for order status management. This phase required extensive debugging of frontend JSX syntax and, crucially, a persistent backend routing issue where the frontend HTML was served for API routes, which was resolved by reordering Express middleware. The work concludes with the final dashboard update pending user verification.

<product_requirements>
The Nuestra Carne application aims to be an online meat shop.
**Completed features prior to this session:**
*   **Design & UX**: New red palette, larger logo, real meat hero image, professional images.
*   **User System**: Complete backend (), React , login/registration page, user dashboard with history, protected routes.
*   **Wholesalers Portal**: Automatic special prices (30% discount) for companies, approval system for wholesalers.
*   **Admin Panel**: Complete panel (Blog, Products, Wholesalers), functional APIs, tab navigation.
*   **Advanced UX**: Pre-filled data for registered users, Sunday enabled internally (marked closed publicly), complete schedules.

**Initial Problems Identified (pre-session):**
*   Frontend-Backend disconnection: Preview site errors, auth/blog endpoints not found, gray images.
*   URL configuration mismatch between development/production ( vs ).
*   Deploy/Cache issues: Changes not reflecting immediately, preview vs. production showing different versions.

**Immediate Critical Tasks (as per initial prompt):**
1.  Fix frontend-backend connection in production.
2.  Verify correct URLs on .
3.  Confirm deploy functionality.
4.  Full functionality test on the live site.

**New Requirements/Issues during session:**
*   **Image Loading**: User reported gray images and images not loading, diagnosed as external URL issues (CORS/403 errors).
*   **Order Management**: User reported new orders not appearing in the dashboard and requested functionality to change order statuses from the admin panel (solicitado, en_proceso, en_camino, entregado).

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Node.js/Express**: Backend framework, replacing an initially assumed FastAPI setup.
-   **React**: Frontend framework.
-   **MongoDB**: Database, accessed via backend (though specific interaction details were abstracted).
-   **Supervisor**: Process manager for Node.js backend and React frontend.
-   **Environment Variables ()**: Configuration for URLs and secrets.
-   **API Routing**: Express.js routes, crucial  prefix for Kubernetes ingress.
-   **CORS/Image Hosting**: Handling external image URLs vs. local asset serving.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application has a full-stack architecture consisting of a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend. Data persistence for orders is managed via a local JSON file () for simplicity.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Changes:**

*   ****: Main Express app. Initially misconfigured in supervisor (FastAPI instead of Node.js). Modified to correct the  catch-all route by moving it to the end, ensuring API routes () are handled first.
*   ****: Supervisor configuration. Modified to correctly run the Node.js backend instead of a Python uvicorn server.
*   ****: Environment variables for backend. Was missing, created based on  to provide necessary configurations.
*   ****: **NEW** file. Serves as the persistence layer for all order data. Initially empty, populated as orders are placed.
*   ****: Backend API routes for orders. Significantly modified to:
    *   Implement saving new orders to .
    *   Add new endpoints for fetching orders (, , ).
    *   Add an endpoint for updating order status ().
*   ****: React context for authentication. Modified to add the  prefix to all backend API calls (e.g.,  became ).
*   ****: Displays blog articles. Modified to add  prefix to API calls (e.g.,  became ).
*   ****: Displays a single blog post. Modified to add  prefix to API calls.
*   ****: Component for media uploads. Modified to add  prefix to API calls.
*   ****: Admin dashboard. Modified to integrate the new  component and add a Pedidos (Orders) tab in the navigation.
*   ****: **NEW** component. Provides the interface for administrators to view, detail, and update the status of orders.
*   ****: Admin panel for products. Modified to add  prefix to API calls.
*   ****: Admin panel for wholesalers. Modified to add  prefix to API calls.
*   ****: Main landing page. Modified to add  prefix to API calls and update image references to use local SVGs.
*   ****: User-facing order submission form. Modified to include  in the payload for tracking authenticated users' orders.
*   ****: User's dashboard. Significantly modified to fetch real order data from the backend () instead of using mocked data. Debugging logs were added and simulated data fallback removed to diagnose issues.
*   ****: Global styles. Modified to use local SVG images for hero and CTA backgrounds.
*   ****: **NEW** local SVG image files created (, , , , ) to replace problematic external URLs.

<pending_tasks>
-   **SMTP Password Configuration**: The  in the backend's  file is still a placeholder and needs to be updated with the real Zoho SMTP password for order confirmation emails to function correctly.
-   **User Dashboard Orders Confirmation**: The user needs to force-reload their browser (Ctrl+Shift+R) and verify that the Mis Pedidos section of the dashboard now displays their actual orders and not the simulated data.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on resolving the persistent issue of the user dashboard still displaying simulated order data despite backend order persistence and API routing fixes.

The last actions taken were:
1.  **Modified **: Removed the fallback mechanism that was causing simulated data to display when the API call failed. Also added debug logging within the  function to provide more insight into the network requests and responses.
2.  **Recompiled the frontend**: Executed yarn run v1.22.22
$ cd frontend && npm install && npm run build && cd ../backend && npm install

Done in 76.31s. in  to ensure the latest frontend code changes (including the removal of simulated data and debug logs) were applied to the production build.
3.  **Restarted the backend**: Executed backend: stopped
backend: started to ensure any recent backend changes were active.

The current state is that the frontend has been re-built and the backend restarted. The AI has requested the user to perform a hard refresh of their dashboard in the browser and check the console for specific debug logs, which would indicate whether the frontend is successfully fetching real order data from the backend or if there are still underlying issues preventing the data from being displayed correctly. The  file on the backend was checked and was empty, indicating that the user's previous test orders might not have been saved successfully before the routing fixes.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Confirm with the user if the Mis Pedidos section of their dashboard now displays real order data after a forced browser reload.
