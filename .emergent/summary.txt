The previous AI engineer effectively transformed the Nuestra Carne application from an initial MVP, tackling critical frontend-backend disconnections and diverse feature requests. Early efforts resolved image display issues via local SVGs and established a comprehensive order management system. Subsequent work involved extensive content updates across the landing page, including text alterations, address corrections, and design refinements like a new color palette and button enhancements. A major challenge involved persistent debugging of blog loading and hero image display in deployed environments, primarily due to inconsistent API URL resolution and a recurring double  prefix issue, eventually requiring direct URL hardcoding for production.

More recently, the focus shifted to implementing a robust promotions system with an admin panel and a dynamic delivery fee based on order total. This involved creating new backend routes, a JSON data store for promotions, and integrating the logic into the . The latest work concentrates on resolving a critical synchronization problem: product edits made in the admin panel were not reflecting on the public-facing order form. This was traced to hardcoded product data in backend routes and the frontend  falling back to static data upon API errors. The current task is to debug this product price inconsistency in the OrderForm.

The Nuestra Carne application is an online meat shop, initially suffering from frontend-backend disconnections, misconfigured URLs, and placeholder images. The primary goal was to fix these core issues and expand functionality. Explicit user requests and problems to solve included:
*   **Content Updates**: Revise 48 horas to 2 días, 0 to 0 for free delivery thresholds across UI components (Hero, Delivery, CTA, Footer, OrderForm). Update main claim from ANGUS to Carne 100% Nacional and refine calidad garantizada text.
*   **Address Correction**: Change C. 139 Este, Panamá, Provincia de Panamá to Coopugan - Llanos de Curundú.
*   **Design & Branding**: Integrate black and a wine red (FOLDCOTONE) color palette. Enhance visibility and robustness of the Haz tu pedido button. Add payment methods (Visa, Mastercard, Ach, Yappy) to the footer.
*   **Image Issues**: Resolve hero image failing to appear in production/preview.
*   **Blog Functionality**: Fix blog not loading in production/preview (Error al cargar artículos, Invalid Date), and improve text formatting within blog posts (bolding, spacing, lists).
*   **Mobile Optimization**: Implement cart/order summary positioned at the top on mobile, and make meat categories in the order form function as an accordion.
*   **Product/Service Content**: Change 20 años de experiencia to expertos carniceros, Arrachera to Pulpa negra, Frescura Garantizada to Sin Inyecciones de agua. Update operating hours and add a Cortes Selectos section.
*   **Admin/Features**: Implement a comprehensive promotions system with an admin dashboard for creating and managing promotions. Add a .50 delivery fee for orders under 0, with free delivery for orders 0 and above. Ensure real-time synchronization of product edits made in the admin panel to the public-facing order form. Remove test blog articles.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a full-stack architecture featuring a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend. Data persistence is managed via local JSON files.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Changes:**
*   ****: Main Express application entry point. Critical for middleware ordering; API routes were moved before static file serving to resolve Endpoint not found issues in production. A  route was added for debugging.
*   ****: **NEW** file. Stores all promotion data, enabling persistence for the new promotions system.
*   ****: **NEW** file. Centralized storage for all product data, replacing previously hardcoded product lists. This file now acts as the single source of truth for product information.
*   ****: **NEW** file. Defines backend API endpoints for promotions, including creation, retrieval, updates, deletion, and validation of promo codes.
*   ****: Handles product management within the admin panel. Modified to read from and write to , enabling actual saving of product edits (prices, availability, categories) and toggle functionality, replacing mock updates.
*   ****: Manages public-facing product data retrieval. Updated to fetch product data from  to ensure consistency with admin panel updates, removing hardcoded product lists.
*   ****: Frontend environment variables, specifically . Repeatedly updated to correct hostname mismatches and  suffix inconsistencies in production.
*   ****: Global stylesheet for frontend. Updated hero background image to a local asset. Implemented new FOLDCOTONE color palette and enhanced button styles. Added specific CSS for blog content to ensure correct markdown rendering and spacing.
*   ****: Main admin dashboard component. Modified to integrate the new  component and add a navigation link for promotions.
*   ****: **NEW** file. A React component providing the UI for administrators to manage promotions (create, edit, delete) and view their details.
*   ****: Frontend component for product management in admin. Enhanced to trigger an immediate data refresh () after any product edit or toggle, ensuring changes are reflected from the backend. Fixed instances of double  in API calls.
*   ** & **: Components for displaying blog articles. Corrected double  prefixes, improved date formatting, and simplified API URL construction with a direct hardcoded approach for production to bypass  issues.
*   ****: The public home page. Underwent significant content revisions (text, claims, address, operating hours, service descriptions, product names like Arrachera to Pulpa Negra) and incorporated a new payment methods section in the footer.
*   ****: User-facing order submission form. Implemented dynamic delivery fee calculation (.50 under 0, free over 0) and integrated the promotion code validation logic. Modified for mobile responsiveness, placing the cart above products and introducing an accordion view for product categories. Currently being debugged for not reflecting product price updates.
*   ****: **NEW** file. A dedicated debug page to inspect the frontend's constructed API URL and test various backend endpoints directly from the browser, crucial for diagnosing production connectivity issues.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Pulpa Negra Image Upload**: The user needs to manually upload the actual  image to the  directory, as only a placeholder was created.
-   **Order Form Product Price Synchronization**: Debug why the OrderForm is still displaying old product prices despite backend updates and the  file being correct.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was actively engaged in debugging a critical issue where product price changes, successfully applied and stored in the backend via the admin panel, were not being reflected on the public-facing .

Specifically, while a product like Costillón entero correctly displays its updated price (.35) in the admin dashboard, the  still shows its old price (.25).

The investigation has revealed:
1.  The  component now correctly updates the backend's  file and refreshes its own view to show the new prices.
2.  The backend route  (handled by ), responsible for providing product data to the OrderForm, was previously hardcoding product prices. This was corrected to read from the  file.
3.  Despite  containing the correct updated price, the  endpoint was still returning the old price in previous tests, leading to confusion about caching or synchronization. However, direct inspection of  showed the correct price, and subsequent manual verification of the  showed correct saving.
4.  The current leading hypothesis (from Chat Message 665) is that  is falling back to using its  (hardcoded old product data) whenever its  call to  encounters any error. This suggests that even if the backend is updated, a network error, parsing error, or any other issue during the API call or response handling on the frontend side causes it to revert to stale data.

The AI engineer's immediate action is to add more extensive logging within the  file to precisely pinpoint the cause of this fallback behavior, especially during the  operation for product data. The last command executed was a  on  to prepare for adding these logs.

Add detailed logging within  to diagnose why it falls back to  when fetching product data.
