The previous AI engineer meticulously advanced the Nuestra Carne application from a nearly complete state, resolving critical frontend-backend disconnections and initial image display issues by implementing local SVG placeholders. A major effort was dedicated to building a comprehensive order management system, involving extensive backend API development and frontend integration. Subsequently, the focus shifted to extensive content and design updates based on user feedback, including text changes (ANGUS to 100% Nacional), color palette adjustments, address corrections, and button style enhancements. A recurring challenge has been ensuring these local changes are correctly reflected in the live preview and production environments, often complicated by Git synchronization issues, build failures, and persistent debugging of the blog loading and hero image display due to inconsistent URL resolution and caching/CORS problems in the deployment pipeline.

<product_requirements>
The Nuestra Carne application is an online meat shop, initially featuring a new red palette design, user authentication, a wholesalers portal, and an admin panel. Prior to this session, the application faced frontend-backend disconnection issues, misconfigured URLs, and gray images. Immediate tasks included fixing these connections and verifying deploy functionality.

During the session, new requirements and issues emerged:
*   **Text & Content:** Change ANGUS to Carne 100% Nacional, modify the main claim to Carne 100% Nacional, adjust calidad garantizada to remove money-back guarantee, update entrega rápida to Su pedido en menos de 48 horas and add delivery conditions (free delivery for orders +0 within the metropolitan area).
*   **Address Correction:** Update Agua Dulce to C. 139 Este, Panamá, Provincia de Panamá in the footer.
*   **Design & Branding:** Incorporate more black, use a stronger wine red brand color (FOLDCOTONE palette), and make the Haz tu pedido button more visible and robust.
*   **Image Issues:** Resolve hero image not appearing in production (initially due to external URLs, later due to build path issues).
*   **Blog Functionality:** Fix blog not loading in preview/production (Error al cargar, Invalid Date errors), despite backend API functioning.

-   **Node.js/Express**: Backend framework handling API routes and data.
-   **React**: Frontend framework for dynamic UI.
-   **Supervisor**: Process manager controlling Node.js and React applications.
-   **Environment Variables ()**: Configuration for backend/frontend URLs.
-   **API Routing**: Express.js, with critical  prefix for Kubernetes ingress.
-   **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, a frequent issue between frontend and backend in different environments.
-   **Git/GitHub**: Version control system, central to deployment challenges.

The application utilizes a full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend. Order data is managed using a local JSON file () for persistence.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Changes:**

*   ****: Main Express application. Modified to reorder middleware, placing API routes before the static file serving catch-all to prevent HTML being served for API requests.
*   ****: Supervisor configuration. Corrected to run Node.js/Express backend instead of a Python uvicorn server.
*   ****: Backend environment variables. Created to specify .
*   ****: **NEW** file. Persistent storage for all order data.
*   ****: Backend API for orders. Implemented endpoints for saving, fetching (by user/all), and updating order statuses.
*   ****: Authentication context. All API calls prefixed with .
*   ****: Blog listing page. Modified to add  prefix, fix double  in API calls, correct date formatting, add advanced debugging logs, and implement dynamic API URL detection for different environments (localhost, emergent preview, production).
*   ****: Single blog post page. Similar changes to  for API prefix, double  fix, date formatting, and dynamic API URL detection.
*   ****: **NEW** file. A temporary page for debugging blog API calls and environment variables in live deployments.
*   ****: Main landing page. Extensive text updates (ANGUS to 100% Nacional, quality/delivery claims, button text). Updated image references to local assets (, then ). Corrected footer address.
*   ****: Order submission form. Included  in payload, added delivery condition text.
*   ****: User's dashboard. Fetches real order data from backend (removed mocked data), added debug logs for API calls.
*   ****: Main React component. Added routing for the new  page.
*   ****: Global styles. Updated hero and CTA background images to local SVGs (later to  for hero). Implemented new red and wine color palette, and updated button styles for robustness and visibility.
*   ****: Tailwind CSS configuration. Updated color definitions to match the new FOLDCOTONE palette.
*   ****: **NEW** local SVG image files and JPEGs (, , , , , ) to replace problematic external URLs.
*   ****: Updated meta tags (, , , , , , , ), keywords, and structured data ( address) for SEO.

<pending_tasks>
-   **SMTP Password Configuration**:  in  remains a placeholder.
-   **User Dashboard Orders Confirmation**: User needs to verify if the dashboard now displays actual orders.
-   **Blog Functionality (Production/Preview)**: The blog still reports errors (Error al cargar artículos, Invalid Date) in preview/production despite local fixes and debugging.
-   **Hero Image (Production/Preview)**: The hero image is not appearing in production, only the background color.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was deep-diving into persistent issues with the blog not loading and the hero image not appearing in the preview/production environment, despite previous attempts to fix them locally.

For the **blog issue**, the AI has:
1.  Identified and fixed double  prefixes in  and .
2.  Corrected Invalid Date errors by refining date formatting.
3.  Implemented dynamic API URL detection in , , and  to adapt to different hostnames (localhost,  preview, production).
4.  Added extensive  debugging statements (with emojis) to trace network requests and responses, URL detection, and error handling for the user to copy.
5.  Created a new  page in  and  to specifically debug the API call in isolation.

For the **hero image issue**, the AI has:
1.  Switched the hero background image in  from an external URL (which was being blocked in production) to a local image ().
2.  Confirmed that Webpack correctly processes and includes this local image in the build output.

All these changes have been compiled and committed locally. However, the user's latest feedback indicates that the blog is *still* not loading in the preview, and the hero image is *still* not visible in production. The user expressed frustration and mentioned creating a fork. The core problem appears to be a disconnect between local functionality and what's observed in the deployed environments, likely due to Git synchronization or a misconfigured deployment pipeline that doesn't fully reflect the local changes, or a deeper environment-specific issue.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to continue debugging the blog and hero image issues by thoroughly analyzing the console logs from the deployed preview environment, focusing on the API responses and image loading paths.
